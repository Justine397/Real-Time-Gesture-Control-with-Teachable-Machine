# Real-Time Gesture Control with Teachable Machine

This project is a simple gesture control system that uses a webcam and a pre-trained Teachable Machine model to detect hand gestures in real-time. It recognizes three specific gestures: 

- **Thumbs Up** for "Go" – turns the background blue.
- **Open Palms** for "Stop" – turns the background red.
- **Neutral** (no specific gesture) – keeps the background white.

The background color and status text update dynamically based on the detected gesture. Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, the project leverages TensorFlow.js to integrate machine learning and webcam input.
